## Project Description

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Project designed with CSS and SCSS, Using the "Normalize CSS" template, and style guided by the FIGMA Drafts provided by Holberton.
